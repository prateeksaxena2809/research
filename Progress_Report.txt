Goal :- To match derivational related forms in parallel corpora

Solution 1:- Match derivational roots and affixes separately

Ideology for solution 1:-Derivational roots matches are less in number than matches of all corresponding derivations. Reasons are:-
1. Single word derivation correspondence is not a necessary condition across languages
2. Training corpus does not have all derivations of each word


Steps
1. Break English words into derivational root and affix
	i. Find common English affixes from data
	ii. Break word with best probable affix
2. Break Hindi words into derivational root and affix
	i. Find common Hindi affixes from data
	ii. Break word with best probable affix
3. Match using NMT
4. Join affixes with roots in the translation
5. Compare with plain NMT


Prerequisites
1. Run plain NMT and measure the accuracy

Issues:-
1. Handling multiple affixes
2.
